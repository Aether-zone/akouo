 * The events loculus publishes about objects, as akouo reads them.

 * package and carries the shared *vocabulary* — `AetherEvent` — while this is
 * one service's private announcement about its own storage; loculus declares it
 * in its own source for the same reason. So the two ends agree by convention,
 * and the schema below is what holds akouo to its half: a producer that changes
 * a field name gets a logged drop here rather than an undefined silently written
 * to a row.
 *
 * If a third service ever needs these, that is the moment to move them into
 * organon — not before.

 * Either way akouo's answer is the same, which is why nothing here branches on
 * which one sent it.
